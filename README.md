# Deep_learning_prevision_Keras
Last Checkpoint: 2023-09-23

Regression for database passangers, bicicletas.

### 📋 Prerequisites

* [Anaconda-Navigator](https://www.anaconda.com/)
```
* Jupyter notebook - is part of anaconda
```
* [Python-3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## ⚙️ Running the codes:

### First run the notebook:
0_Keras-Linear-Regression_Passengers

### Then run the note book:
1_Recurrent-Neural-Networks_bicicletas

### Note:  two environments were used for this project, one environment for preprocessing and another for classification, due to some incompatibilities with keras x TomekLinks.

## 🛠️ Frameworks  

* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* TomekLinks
* Pickle
* Sklearn
* Keras
* Tensor-flow
